- Make (optional, but highly recomended)
  - git-bash for windows users (or other unix shell interpreter)

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
make setup
```

<!-- TODO: Runnable through meltano

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-nubank
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-nubank --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-nubank target-jsonl
```
